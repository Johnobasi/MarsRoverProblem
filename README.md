# MarsRoverProblem
I followed the approach where to define the grid of 5, 5 to move the rover forward and spin the rover right and left on the mars. First of all, define the start position of rover with respect to X and Y coordinates and initial direction (N, E, W, and S).  Secondly, NASA can send the commands in string to move and spin its rover on the mars. After that once rover get the commands then it behave with according to the given commands. I used some method like Rotate90Left() to spin/rotate the rover 90 degree left, Rotate90Right()  to spin/rotate the rover 90 degree, MoveInSameDirection() method move the rover in forward direction and Start_Moving(List<int> maxPoints, string moves) method used to get the commands in string to operate the rover according to the string.
